**Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading.**
This author did a quite good job on asking this question. The title was clear, although it could be better if it included more details related to this scenario. The author introduced his/her problem with an easily-understandable example and showed his/her own research work by pointing out the use of the between function to address the problem, so that I only need to focus on the very last specific part to achieve the goal. Overall, the code was concise and complete. The only thing that could be improved is that, the author didnâ€™t notice to include the package to operate the between function he/she used, which is dplyr. I could not run through all the code without loading this package, which made his/her code irreproducible.
