## Prompt:

Asking good questions is a valuable skill to have - asking questions in an online setting is both easier and harder than asking questions in person: we can prepare to ask a question but we are also expected to prepare.
The links posted here give some advice on how to ask good questions:

- stackoverflow's [Asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

- R's [Posting guidelines](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)

- [minimal complete verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)

Follow these links and read through the advice given, then

1. **Pick at least one question from stackoverflow or the R help and answer it.**

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

2. **Document which question you answered (link to your answer).**
My answer (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70871253/summation-series-in-r/70871454#70871454)

3. **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading. **

The question I answered had a clear title and the problem was summerized nicely. 
The question has a minimum reproducible example. Sample data is also provided. I could clearly understood what she/he was asking for. It was a very specific question and I did not need any other information to answer it. I reproduce the data in my local computer and write a script to get the answer. It was a fairly small problem and I posted the answer. 
But I faced few challenges to format my answer while posting it in stackoverflow.
