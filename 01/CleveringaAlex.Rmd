## Prompt:

Asking good questions is a valuable skill to have - asking questions in an online setting is both easier and harder than asking questions in person: we can prepare to ask a question but we are also expected to prepare.
The links posted here give some advice on how to ask good questions:

- stackoverflow's [Asking a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

- R's [Posting guidelines](https://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html)

- [minimal complete verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve), [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/)

Follow these links and read through the advice given, then

1. **Pick at least one question from stackoverflow or the R help and answer it.**

Write a blog post answering the following questions: 

2. **Document which question you answered (link to your answer).**

3. **Relate your experience of answering the question to your reading. **

It was difficult because the person asking the question did not provide a minimal reproducible example. I did my best to include the assumptions I made in answering 
their question so that if my answer doesn't work, they might be able to figure out why. Because they did not provide an example, I had to validate my solution with 
a dataset of my own. Being on the other side of a question online about R than I normally am, I can appreciate why StackOverflow asks for things to be done a certain way.
