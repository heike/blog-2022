2. My experience answering this question
  - **Title**: In my openion, the individual provided an appropriate title to the question asked. This gave me a foreknowledge of what to expect. 
  - **Body**: The individual provided an explanation of his challenge. Including the Error message and a code was useful. 
  - **Reproducibility**: Even though the individual included a code, I received a different Erro message when I tried to reproduce the code. I was able to answer this question because of the code provided. 
                         This would've been impossible in complicated situations.
